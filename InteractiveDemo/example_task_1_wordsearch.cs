/*
There is an ASCII text file of English words and names available at:
https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tech.test/wordlist.txt

Write a C# console application that takes two arguments – a required word-length, and a search word – 
and lists, in alphabetical order, every word from the online word list that matches the specified 
length AND contains all the characters from the search word, in order but not necessarily consecutively.

Your program should download a fresh copy of the word list from the above URL each time it is run.

For example:
C:\>wordlist.exe 9 html
Should print to the console all the nine-letter words containing the letters "h", "t", "m" and "l", in that order.  
In this example, your output should be:
nachtmaal
shtreimel
wheatmeal
